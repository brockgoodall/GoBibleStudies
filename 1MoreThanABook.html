<h1>MORE THAN A BOOK</h1>
<p> The Bible is by far the best-selling book of all time! There are currently around 6 billion Bibles in print. If we were to stack every Bible in the world side by side they would stretch across about 120,000km. To put that into perspective, Australia is 4000km wide. So if you wanted to make
a bookshelf that would fit every single Bible on it, it would need to be 30 times the length of Australia. <em>Why do you think the Bible is so popular?</em></p>
<br>    
<h2>Isaiah 55:10-11</h2>
<p><em>What does God say is the purpose of the rain and snow falling?</em> The purpose of the rain and snow falling is to nourish and bring life, to make things bloom, flourish and blossom! God then says in the very next verse that His Word is no different. Its purpose is not to give us more information or knowledge. Its purpose is to transform! <em>If you’ve read the Bible before, have you ever felt different afterwards?</em></p>
<br>
<h2>2 Timothy 3:16–17</h2>
<p>This passage says the same kind of thing as Isaiah 55:10-11. It says that the Bible equips us to do good works. <em>What is the difference between telling and equipping?</em> When you’re told to do something, you’re on your own. When you’re equipped, you’re being helped by someone. So when we read the Bible, God helps us to do good works, transforming us to be more like Him.</p>
<br> 
<h2>Colossians 3:16</h2>
<p>In order for this transformation to occur, we must “let” the Word of God dwell within us
and fill our lives. “Let” implies that this is an action that happens to us. We can’t force the transformation, but as we spend time with God in his Word He is the one that changes us. <em>In what ways could you let the Word of God to fill your life?</em></p>

	<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>
	<p>This week, find 30 minutes that you can set aside to sit quietly and read the Bible. If you’re not sure where to start, try the Gospel of Mark. Take notice of what God might be doing within you as you read.</p>
