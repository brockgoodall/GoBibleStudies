<h1>THE DIVINE OBSESSION</h1>
    <p><em>Do you know what a groupie is?</em> Groupies are those passionate, over-the-top fans who will go to any length to show their love for and pursue a relationship with a particular celebrity. In England, there’s a young woman who would identify as a groupie. She went so far as to legally change her surname to pretend she’s married to Justin Bieber! What’s crazy is that the Bible proves God to have a similar level of obsession with us!</p>
<br>
<h2>Psalms 139:1–10, 17–18</h2>
    <p><em>What was the biggest “Aha!” moment for you when you read this passage?</em> God knows our every move and our every thought because He thinks the world of us. If we were to count how many times God thinks about us, there would be more thoughts than there are grains of sand in the whole world! Interestingly, some researchers from the University of Hawaii calculated that there are approximately seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains of sand in the world. That’s a lot of thoughts!</p>
<br>
<h2>1 John 4:9–10</h2>
    <p>What distinguishes God from most groupies is that He was willing to die for us. <em>But why did Jesus need to die?</em> In Romans 6, the Bible says that the consequences of sin is eternal death. But God’s love for us meant that He wouldn’t be happy spending eternity without us so He went to the length of dying for us so that He could! <em>What difference does it make in your life to know that God is that obsessed with you?</em></p>
<br> 
<h2>Ephesians 2:8–9</h2>
    <p><em>What do we need to be saved?</em> The Bible says that there is nothing we can do to earn it for ourselves because it is a gift! All we need to do is accept that gift. God loves us so much that He gives this gift freely to us, even though it cost Him everything, including His life.</p>
