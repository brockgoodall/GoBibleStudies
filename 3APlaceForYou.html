<h1>A PLACE FOR YOU</h1>
    <p><em>What is the most romantic thing you’ve ever seen done?</em> In 2014, a man in China purchased 99 iPhones and arranged them in a heart shape to propose to his girlfriend. Unfortunately she said no, leaving him heart broken and $100,000 poorer! He may not have 99 iPhones, but Jesus is actually doing something really romantic for you.</p>
<br>
<h2>John 14:1–3</h2>
    <p>In Bible times, after a man proposed to the woman he loved, he would temporarily go back to his family’s property to build a place for them to live in. Once the preparations were complete, he would marry his bride and take her to their new home to live. <em>What connection do you see between these customs and John 14?</em> Jesus is likening himself to a groom because He wants us to know that He will definitely return for us like a groom would for his bride.</p>
<br>
<h2>John 13:31–38</h2>
    <p>When the Bible was written, there were no verses or chapters. Each book was one complete story. <em>How might John 13:31-38 then impact our understanding of John 14:1-3?</em> In John 13, Jesus predicted that Peter would deny that he knows Jesus three times. In the very next breath, Jesus uttered the words of John 14. The place He is preparing isn’t for perfect people. Anyone can belong. <em>What does this tell us about Jesus? And what hope does this give you?</em></p>
<br> 
<h2>1 Thessalonians 4:13–17</h2>
    <p><em>What stands out to you in this passage?</em> In Bible times, when the groom returned for his wife after preparing a place for her, it was a big deal. His arrival was announced with the sound of trumpets. In 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17, it describes Jesus’ return in a similar way. It’s going to be big. Trumpets will sound. The dead will come back to life. Loved ones will be reunited. Then Jesus will take them to be with Him in the place He has prepared.</p>
