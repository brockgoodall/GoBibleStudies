<h1>MAKING IT PUBLIC</h1>
    <p>Making your relationship with someone else official on Facebook seems to be a big deal these days. Why? Because that is the moment that a relationship between two people becomes public knowledge. In previous studies, we’ve seen how much God loves us and wants a relationship with us. This study is about how to make that relationship public. <em>Why do you think it’s important for someone’s relationship with God to be public?</em></p>
<br>
<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Acts 16:30–34</h2>
    <p>In this story, a prison guard believed in God for the first time and began a relationship with Him after experiencing a huge miracle. You’ll notice that the very next thing he did was get baptised as a public declaration of that relationship. <em>But why baptism? Why don’t we just update our status on Facebook to let our friends know about our relationship with God?</em></p>
<br>
<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Romans 6:3–4</h2>
    <p><em>How does Romans 6:3-4 help us understand why we do baptism?</em> Baptism symbolises our acceptance of Jesus’ death and resurrection. Getting baptised means we believe in Jesus and have made a choice to do life with Him. We symbolically ‘bury’ our old self and ‘rise’ into a new life with Jesus. This is why when someone gets baptised, they are dunked under water and then brought back out.</p>
<br> 
<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Acts 8:35–38</h2>
    <p><em>Based on this story and the story about the prison guard, when do you think someone should get baptised?</em> In this story, the eunuch heard about Jesus, believed in Him and, as soon as he saw water, pulled over and got baptised. Baptism is the start of someone’s journey, not a destination. <em>Why do you think some people feel like they need to know everything or become perfect before they are baptised?</em></p>

	<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>
	<p>If you haven’t been baptised, think about whether or not you would like to be baptised in the near future. If you have been baptised, think about who you can encourage to be baptised this week.</p>
