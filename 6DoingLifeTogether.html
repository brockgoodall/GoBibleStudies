<h1>DOING LIFE TOGETHER</h1>
    <p>Making your relationship with someone else official on Facebook seems to be a big deal these days. Why? Because that is the moment that a relationship between two people becomes public knowledge. In previous studies, we’ve seen how much God loves us and wants a relationship with us. This study is about how to make that relationship public. <em>Why do you think it’s important for someone’s relationship with God to be public?</em></p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Hebrews 10:25</h2>
    <p><em>What stands out to you as you read this passage?</em> These words were written about 2000 years ago, instructing Christians to continue meeting together especially because Jesus would be returning to earth soon. We don’t know when Jesus will return but we do know that we are 2000 years closer now than when this was written. So church is more important now than ever before.</p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Acts 2:42–47</h2>
    <p>This is a description of the early church. Although things may be culturally very different today, this is an example for us to follow. <em>What elements of church in this passage are important for us today?</em> We attend church so that we can worship God in community, support one another and grow in our relationship with Him. According to this passage, church is a central part of the Christian experience. <em>If you currently go to church, why is it that you go?</em></p>
 
<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Romans 12:4–5</h2>
    <p>One of the major ways the church is talked about in the Bible is as a body. <em>Why do you think that might be? And how does this help you understand what it means to be a part of a church?</em> Church is a place where people of different backgrounds and skill sets come together as one with the focus of Jesus. Everyone belongs, and everyone has a part to play. That’s what community is all about.</p>
