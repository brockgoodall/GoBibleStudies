<h1>BEYOND BUSYNESS</h1>
    <p>It seems that when you ask most people how they are going these days, the response is often “busy”. In our culture, we often wear our busyness like it’s a badge of honour. It makes us feel important and needed. <em>Why do we do this?</em> God has a lot to say about working hard but He doesn’t want that to be our life’s purpose.</p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Genesis 2:1–3</h2>
    <p>On the seventh day of creation, God decided to take a day to rest from His work. <em>Why might God have done this?</em> God isn’t subject to tiredness like we are as humans. God was simply resting from His work on the seventh day, also called the Sabbath, as an example to us. He wants us to take a day each week to rest from our work. <em>Why do you think this is the case?</em></p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Deuteronomy 5:12–15</h2>
    <p>The Israelites had just been set free from 400 years of slavery in Egypt. As slaves, they worked non-stop and their worth came from what they could do and how much they could do. Now that they were free, God was reminding them of the Sabbath — a day to stop, recognise that there is more to life than work and realise that they are more valuable than what they do. This is why the Sabbath is so important! <em>How could this change the way people see themselves?</em></p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Mark 2:23–28</h2>
    <p><em>What does this passage tell us about the Sabbath?</em> When Jesus was on earth, the Israelites had forgotten what was at the heart of the Sabbath. They made a list of things you could and couldn’t do on the Sabbath. In this passage, Jesus highlights that the Sabbath wasn’t created to be a chore but it is actually for our benefit. He is showing us that the Sabbath is an opportunity to pause, focus on relationships with God and each other, and discover what it really means to be human.</p>
