<h1>GO</h1>
    <p>This is our final Bible study but this is not the end for you. It’s just the beginning. As a follower of Jesus, God calls you to something huge. It’s kind of daunting but it’s so rewarding. <em>Have you ever done something that was scary but really rewarding?</em></p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Matthew 28:18–20</h2>
    <p>Last words are important and these were Jesus’ last words to His followers before leaving earth. He commanded them to go and make more followers of Him and He wants us to do the same. <em>What would happen if Christians decided not to bother with this anymore?</em> Christianity would eventually die. This is why it is important for us to make more followers of Jesus.</p>

<h2 class="study-sub-headings">1 Peter 2:9</h2>
    <p>In the Old Testament, it was the job of priests to connect people with God. In 1 Peter 2:9, the Bible implies that this is no longer the case. It is saying that everyone that follows Jesus is now part of the priesthood. <em>What implications does this have for our lives?</em> This means that it’s not just the job of pastors to connect people with God; it’s up to all of us.</p>
 
<h2 class="study-sub-headings">Acts 4:13</h2>
    <p>In this story, Peter and John had just shared the message of Jesus with a group of leaders and teachers of religious law. <em>What was it about Peter and John that amazed this group of leaders and teachers?</em> It was the fact that they were untrained, ordinary men, yet God was using them to do extraordinary things. God doesn’t just look for the most talented individuals to make more followers of Him. He can use anyone and He will use anyone.</p>

	<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>
	<p>Your challenge this week is to think about someone that you can lead to Jesus in Bible studies. The Bible study resource that we’ve used over the last 8 weeks is really easy to use and I can get you a copy as well as show you how to use it.</p>
